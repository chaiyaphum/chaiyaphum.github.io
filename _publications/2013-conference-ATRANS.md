This paper presents an algorithm for traffic anomaly detection based on information from offline probe vehicles, traffic anomalies in this paper refers to anomalous traffic patterns associated with traffic incidents. Currently, fixed sensors have been used for detecting abnormal traffic, such as loop detectors and traffic cameras, but they have problems with installation, maintenance, and the distribution of fixed sensors. The basic idea in the traffic anomaly detection using mobile sensors is that by observing the speed of the probe vehicles, probe vehicles should be in a slow-moving speed at the incident. When probe vehicles pass the incident, they will move at a normal speed. In this study, we use the incident data from a traffic simulation based on Gipps safe-distance car-following model. The methodology of incident detection process consists of two parts: 1) detecting abnormal traffic patterns and behavior of each probe vehicle; 2) calculating the probability of abnormal incident occurrences from several probe vehicles in the same time period, then comparing the probability of an abnormal incident with the previous period. The preliminary experiment result shows the evaluation of the performance of the incident detection in terms of Detection Rate (DR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR). This algorithm can detect abnormal traffic incident and estimate the position of an abnormal incident and abnormal levels of incident.
