excerpt: '<b>Summary: </b>This paper conducts a performance analysis of two popular private blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum (private deployment), to assess the performance and limitations of these state-of-the-art platforms. The experimental results, based on varying number of transactions, show that Hyperledger Fabric consistently outperforms Ethereum across all evaluation metrics which are execution time, latency and throughput. Additionally, both platforms are still not competitive with current database systems in term of performances in high workload scenarios.'

This paper conducts a performance analysis of two popular private blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum (private deployment), to assess the performance and limitations of these state-of-the-art platforms. Blockchain, a decentralized transaction and data management technology, is said to be the technology that will have similar impacts as the Internet had on people's lives. Many industries have become interested in adopting blockchain in their IT systems, but scalability is an often- cited concern of current blockchain technology. Therefore, the goals of this preliminary performance analysis are twofold. First, a methodology for evaluating a blockchain platform is developed. Second, the analysis results are presented to inform practitioners in making decisions regarding adoption of blockchain technology in their IT systems. The experimental results, based on varying number of transactions, show that Hyperledger Fabric consistently outperforms Ethereum across all evaluation metrics which are execution time, latency and throughput. Additionally, both platforms are still not competitive with current database systems in term of performances in high workload scenarios.
